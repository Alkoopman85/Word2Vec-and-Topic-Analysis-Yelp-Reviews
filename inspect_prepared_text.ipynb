    "# Data Prep Inspection\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at the data prep for the LDA and word2vec models. The process starts with the spacy processing pipeline. This results in the writing of two files one contains only unigram sentences one sentence per line and the other contains unigram reviews one review per line. This saves us a step and we will only have to pass the text through the spacy pipeline once which is quite time consuming. Next we train our bigram Phrases model and wright the output of that model to a file. That output is then used to train our trigram Phrases model and the corpus is then passed through it to get an output sutable for the word to vec model. Finlly we feed the unigram review corpus through our bigram and trigram Phrases models, remove stopwords and wright out the processed reviews sutable for training our LDA model.\n",

      "Tried this place out after many suggestions from friends.  We went in one night about an hour or so before closing just to find that they were only serving a partial menu - we're not talking that late, it was like, 9:30 on a weekend.  There was no mention of going down to a bar menu on the website so I was a bit annoyed by that.  Something about 'surprise disappointments that could be totally avoided' really bother me.  So, the dish I had picked out online wasn't available and I ordered a burger instead.  The server seemed to have a very hard time understanding my burger and suggested that modifications couldn't be made?  I told him I'm sure removing a single topping wouldn't cause the kitchen staff any issues...  The rest of the meal we were generally ignored and the service wasn't great.  I found the food to be overpriced for the quality.  Unless there is a special reason to attend, I don't think we'll be going back.\n",

The location is kind of far from other stuff which normally wouldn't bother me but everything around is seriously industrial and scenery does make a better place. They do discount the beer $1 when a train comes by and maybe that's the best they can make of a meh location. Probably give it more like a 3.5 stars.
